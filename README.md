# Updated-Server
Creating a local host server that runs in conjunction with the NPM package express. This updated server contains a friends list that you can GET 1 or more friends from a database, or POST a new friends to a database that is in JSON format. 
This also includes "nodemon" so you can run the script in the terminal; "npm run watch" and the server will run whilst you make edits without having to stop and restart the server.
